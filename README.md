Importance:	States have turned to novel financing mechanisms to pay for community health worker (CHW) programs, often through fee-for-service payments for CHWs visiting patients, or through capitated payments for CHWs to care for a panel of patients as part of a managed care organization or alternative payment model. 

Objective: 	To estimate payment rates to ensure sustainability of CHW programs.
